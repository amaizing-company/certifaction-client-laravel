# Introduction

This laravel package acts as client and allows your application to communicate with certifactions signature services. 
It contains preconfigured jobs, events and database models, they easily could integrate into your application. 
It provides also the ability to work directly with the api request and response classes, in case you want to build up
your own logic.

The package is dependent on Certifaction's services. An account and an API key from Certifaction are required to 
communicate with Certifaction's service. Further information can be found on the Certifaction website.
